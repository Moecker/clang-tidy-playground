# Build and Use
## Prerequisites
* git
* cmake
* ninja
* arc

## Structure
The README assumes that this structure is present (or will become present) under `~/llvm`
```

```

## Check-out LLVM into llvm-project
Clone from Github (https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project).

`git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git`

If you want to work on master branch, skip the next steps.

## Apply const-correctness patch for release/10.x branch
Checkout the release 10.x branch since the const-correctness patch is designed for this version.

`git checkout release/10.x`

Apply the const-correctness patch from arc (https://reviews.llvm.org/D54943). This requires to have an Phabricator account which can be linked from yout Gihub Account. The command will guide you.

`arc patch D54943`

## Build LLVM
Change into the root directory `~/llvm`. Choose the installation directory wisely. It makes sense to have one build and one install directory per release.

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -G Ninja -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang;clang-tools-extra" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="~/llvm/install" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="release" ../llvm-project/llvm
cmake --build ..
cmake --install ..
```

## Run clang-tidy
Clang-tidy runs best when provided with a compilation database where it can find all compilation flags.

### Create a compilation database
In case of cmake this is a build in option. In case of bazel an own solution is required. Change into the project root and execute the following commands. There is no need to build the project.
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1 -G Ninja .. 
```

### Run clang-tidy via the python helper script (recommended)
This is an advanced command with applying fixes. Checkout all options with the `-h` parameter. This command must run in the project's root directory so clang-tidy is able to find all referenced files.
```bash
~/llvm/install/share/clang/run-clang-tidy.py -p build -clang-tidy-binary ~/llvm/install/bin/clang-tidy -clang-apply-replacements-binary ~/llvm/install/bin/clang-apply-replacements -checks="cppcoreguidelines*,-clang-analyzer*" -header-filter=".*" -fix
```

### Run clang-tidy as standalone tool (not recommended)
One can also directly invoke clang-tidy.
```bash
~/llvm/install/bin/clang-tidy -p build/compile_commands.json --checks="cppcoreguidelines*" --header-filter=".*" main.cpp
```

## Hints
Find out all possible or enabled checks

`~/llvm/install/bin/clang-tidy --list-checks --checks="*"`
